##This project is a simple web application that displays a random inspirational quote whenever the "Generate!" button is clicked.

###Features
*Fetches inspirational quotes from a JSON file (optional, fallback to default quotes available if fetch fails).
*Shuffles the quotes for a more random experience.
*Displays the quote and optionally the author.
*Uses Vanilla CSS for basic styling


###Running the Project
*This project has no backend server, just a JSON file holding the quotes object for future implementation. It won't fetch or parse the data due to CORS restrictions and instead defaults to the quote object in the jaavascript file.*
